 SYSeg - System Software by Example
 ========================================
 SYSeg (System Software, e.g.) is a collection of source-code examples and 
 programming exercises intended to illustrate general concepts and techniques 
 related to system software design and implementation.

 About
 -------------------------------------------
 
 SYSeg has been compiled from class notes in undergraduate and graduate courses 
 in Computer Science and Engineering, and is meant to  be useful for students
 and instructors interested in low-level programming, either as a self-learning
 resource or as part of a systematized teaching material.

 The collection addresses concepts such as application binary interface
 (ABI), runtime system, program build chain, operating systems and related
 subjects, with source-code examples illustrating the implementation of
 shared libraries, dynamic linking, address relocation, position-independent
 code, POSIX API, file systems, build automation, among other topics.

 SYSeg official repository is at https https://github.com/monacofj/syseg.

 Currently, the material is mainly focused on the x86 platform.


 Quick start
 -----------------------------------------------

 Before you dig into the contents, read this.
 
 Most code examples and programming exercises require auxiliary artifacts 
 (including the documentation!) which must be built beforehand. 

 In order to get those items built you **must** perform the setup procedure.

 Please, read `doc/syseg.md` and proceed as explained.

 There you will also find instructions on how to use SYSeg code examples,
 as well as the requirements and dependencies your system needs to meet
 in order to build and execute SYSeg tools.

 **IMPORTANT**

 In case you have rushed through this file and has not been convinced to read
 the essential documentation, this is an encouragement note:

 **please, do read `doc/syseg.md`**

 It'll assuredly save you time

 (this file is named `README` for a reason).

 Content overview
 ------------------------------
 
 SYSeg contents. 

 - Directory `eg`    contains the main source code examples.
 - Directory `try`   contains suggested programming exercises.
 - Directory `tools` contains auxiliary tools used by examples and exercises.
 - Directory `doc`   contains SYSeg documentation.
 - Directory `extra` contains side notes, arcane features and hacker lore.
 - Directory `draft` contains work-in-progress material (likely buggy)

 Each subdirectory contains a `README` file further explaining its contents.
 
 Contributing
 ------------------------------
 
 Should you like to contribute code, please, refer to the file
 `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

 Bug reports and suggestions are always welcome.

 Feel free to open and issue at the version-control repository.

 The file `AUTHORS` lists all contributors and acknowledgments, with
 respective contact information.

 I have a matter
 ------------------------------

 SYSeg is a work in progress and, as such, may contain suboptimal code and
 potential technical innacuracies resulting of reliance on imprecise or misleading
 references. If you ever detect one such problem, it would be great if you could 
 drop the author a note.
 
 If it is not much trouble, please open an issue at the repository and
 apply it the lable 'matter'. There, explain what should be improved
 (well, if you are in the mood of submitting a PR/MR, that would be great!)
